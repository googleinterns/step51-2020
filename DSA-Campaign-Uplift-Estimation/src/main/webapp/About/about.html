        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>This project aims to address two main problems with the current Dynamic Search Ads framework. The first
            involves the lack of transparency associated with automated products and the limited predictability of DSA and 
            machine learning in general. Users have no guarantee that using DSA will produce the results they intend,
            creating some risk for users attempting to transition over from their traditional keyword campaigns
            to DSA. The second issue involves the sometimes unnecessary complexity of DSA. Especially for newer advertisers and smaller
            companies, incorporating DSA into their already confusing keyword campaigns only adds another layer of complexity.</p>
        <p>This project aims to address both of these issues by allowing advertisers to run test DSA campaigns with
            easy-to-use UIs, so they can estimate the uplift DSA can bring to their keyword campaigns. Users can
            experiment with different DSA campaign settings when creating their DSA campaigns, and the results of the
            campaigns are displayed on the home and compare pages in clear, efficient charts and graphs. By allowing 
            users to clearly see the value DSA can bring to their ad campaigns, this project hopes to convince more 
            users to incorporate DSA into their ad campaigns.</p>
        <p>This project is a model of what DSA could eventually implement. Many changes would have to be made for this
            project to be used in production, such as a more accurate estimation feature, a cleaner, simpler UI, and 
            auto-generated campaign settings using AI.</p>
        <h3>User Experience</h3>
        <p>When users access the site, they first have to login in order to view their created DSA campaigns. When they
            access the home page, they will see information on all of their previously created DSA campaigns in the form 
            of charts and graphs. Three test keyword campaigns have been created so that all users can interact with the 
            UI and experiment with creating their own DSA campaigns. If implemented in production, the tool would pull keyword
            campaigns from a user's existing Google Ads account.</p> 
        <p>The create page is where users create and run DSA campaigns. After a user inputs all the required settings and runs
            the campaign, the estimation results will be able to be viewed on the home and compare pages.</p>
        <p>The compare page allows users to easily compare the results of their different DSA campaigns. Users can select
            any number of their created DSA campaigns to compare, and the uplift statistics will be displayed along with 
            the inputted campaign settings and generated search query reports.</p>
        <h3>Settings Explanations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start/End Dates (Optional) - used to calculate the campaign duration for uplift estimations. The default values
                 for the start and end dates are the present date and one year in the future, respectively.</li>
            <li>Manual CPC - how much to spend for every ad click.</li>
            <li>Daily Budget - maximum amount to spend in a day.</li>
            <li>Locations - ads from the campaign will target users at the given locations. Currently only the US and US states are supported. 
                Ex: display ads to users living in California and Texas.</li>
            <li>Negative Locations - locations to not target. Negative locations can only be selected if the entire US is the
                initial target. Ex: target every state in the US except for California and Texas.</li>
            <li>Domain - main website link.</li>
            <li>Target Pages - additional pages to direct users to in ads. The estimation process already generates a list of 
                pages to direct users to, but the target pages allow advertisers to specifically include pages on the website
                that may be missed.</li>
            <li>Ad Text - custom description to display along with the ad.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Estimation Results Explanations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Impressions - number of times an ad is displayed on a search result page.</li>
            <li>Clicks - number of times an ad link is clicked on.</li>
            <li>Cost - total cost of the ad campaign.</li>
            <li>Search Query Report (SQR) - contains the most likely queries that would cause an ad to be displayed and the 
                corresponding landing pages.</li>
            <li>Uplift - calculated by taking the difference between the estimation results of the DSA campaign and associated 
                keyword campaign and multiplying by the campaign duration.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Estimation Algorithm</h3>
        <p>The estimation process takes into account all of the factors inputted on the create page, as well as the settings of
            the associated keyword campaign. The estimation process does not resemble the way DSA works in production - 
            various formulas are used to factor in the settings to obtain the rough estimates. The parts of the process that
            involve the most complexity are generating the locations and website factors. To obtain the locations factor, the
            algorithm uses 2019 US Census data population estimates to analyze the number of people targeted in the DSA campaign 
            versus that of the keyword campaign. This relative difference is used in the final estimation calculations.
        <p>To create a website factor for the provided domain and target page links, the algorithm implements a web crawler to 
            analyze the target pages and many of the pages linked to on the domain. The algorithm performs a keyword analysis on 
            pages to search for a common theme or thread of ideas. While performing the keyword analyses, the algorithm also
            generates the SQR as a by-product.

        <h3>Hangouts Bot</h3>
        <p>The Hangouts Bot provides an alternative way of creating DSA campaigns other than going through the webpage. Through a chat context,
          users can configure DSA campaigns step by step, with help provided as needed.
          <p>To access the bot:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <a href='https://chat.google.com/'>chat.google.com</a>.</li>
            <li>At the top left corner, click search and select <b>Find a Bot</b>.</li>
            <li>Search for <b>DSA Configuration Bot</b> and select the bot to begin creating your campaign.</li>
          </ol>
