### Project Description 
This is our capstone project for the 2020 Google STEP Intern Program. The purpose of the web app is to simplify the Dynamic Search Ads process and decrease some of the complexity and confusion associated with DSA. The web app allows users to create different test DSA campaigns with their own desired settings, and with these input settings the web app estimates the results of the DSA campaign and the expected uplift the DSA campaign could bring to the user's existing keyword campaigns. Users can easily experiment with and compare different DSA campaigns, and all of the settings/results come with explanations for added clarity.

Our capstone project also includes a Hangouts Bot as an alternative to the web app which further simplifies the user experience. This bot allows users to create new campaigns, edit unsubmitted campaigns, view campaign results, and delete campaigns. Additionally, it allows for session-independent interactions between the user meaning that if the user were to leave at any time or quit the campaign at any time, it is possible to begin editing the campaign at where the user left off. Each message sent by the bot utilizes the Hangouts Card format, making interactions minimal and free of the clutter of text messages. To use the bot, navigate to [Hangouts](chat.google.com), click the top left search bar, click **Find a Bot**, and search for **DSA Configuration Bot**. Add the bot and begin configuring!
