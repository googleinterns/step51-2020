# DSA Campaign Uplift Estimation

## Creators: Neel Bagora, Erik Garcia, Nevin George

## Project Description: 
This is our capstone project for the 2020 Google STEP Intern Program. The purpose of the web app is to simplify the Dynamic Search Ads process and decrease some of the complexity and confusion associated with DSA. The web app allows users to create different test DSA campaigns with their own desired settings, and with these input settings the web app estimates the results of the DSA campaign and the expected uplift the DSA campaign could bring to the user's existing keyword campaigns. Users can easily experiment with and compare different DSA campaigns, and all of the settings/results come with explanations for added clarity.
